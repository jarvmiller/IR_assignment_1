This assignment covers a few topics:
- Precision vs Recall, F_{1} score, MAP, DCG
- Conditional probability
- Light text analysis of a corpus of medically related documents
    - word frequency in corpuses
    - pos tagging
    - TD-IDF calculations

Text files are included as well as a jupyter notebook with the solutions. Feel free to look! I mainly enjoyed the third problem as it wasn't tedious and introduced me to packages like *nltk* and *textblob*!
